1. Clone the repo with your preferred method.
2. Add these [user secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets): 
    ```json
    // in secrets.json through Visual Studio...
    {
        "ConnectionStrings.PGSQL": "User ID=postgres;Password=<your password here>;Server=db;Port=5432;Database=retroggdotnet;Integrated Security=true;Pooling=true;",
        "SendGridUser": "<your username here>",
        "SendGridKey": "<your api key here>",
        "SendGridDomain": "@<your domain here>"
    }
    ```
    ```bash
    # ...or on the command line for other IDEs
    # make sure to be in the project folder (inner "RetroGG.net" folder)
    dotnet user-secrets init # init the user secrets
    dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings.PGSQL" "User ID=postgres;Password=<your password here>;Server=db;Port=5432;Database=retroggdotnet;Integrated Security=true;Pooling=true;"
    dotnet user-secrets set "SendGridUser" "<your username here>"
    dotnet user-secrets set "SendGridKey" "<your api key here>"
    dotnet user-secrets set "SendGridDomain" "@<your domain here>"
    ```
3. Add a `.env` file to the base `RetroGG.net` directory and set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD="<your password here>"`
4. Add your Cloudflare Argo Tunnel certificate and config into the `cloudflared` folder.
5. Add a certificate and key for your origin and root CA in `certs`.  
   * They can be selfsigned.
   * Make sure to put the root CA cert in `cloudflared` as well.
   * You can use [this tool](https://certificatetools.com/) to generate the certs.
     * Generate the CA with the default CA settings, make sure to set your domain and DNS to localhost or your
       domain name if you have one. Change the default duration if necessary.
     * When you export the root CA make sure to mark it as persistent in addition to downloading its cert.
     * Now configure the web server certificate using the web server template, make sure to set common names
       and subject alternate names to nginx, localhost, and your domain if you have one.
     * In the CSR options, instead of CSR Only choose the domain you created the root CA under. Finally,
       generate the certificate.

If you use Visual Studio, you're done! You can hit the run button and it should work!  
Otherwise, if you're using Visual Studio Code, follow
[this tutorial](https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/how-to-develop-an-asp-net-core-application-using-visual-studio-code.aspx)
for initial configuration.
> Please note that this tutorial does not cover Docker, you may have to search for VS Code support
> for Docker Compose ASP.NET projects.

If you're using some other IDE, you may have to use a combination of the .NET CLI and Docker Compose commands, or find
extensions that will take care of those for you. Good luck!

## Custom Styling with Bootstrap 5 Beta
